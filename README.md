## Weather Pew

This weather app uses the Weatherbit API for data, React and Rails (found here: https://github.com/malorie16/mod-4-project-backend).

Our app allows users to search forecasts around the globe and save their favorite cities to their homepage.

Made by Anthony Lam and Malorie Casimir for our Mod 4 Project at The Flatiron School //
